# Code Challenge Class 2

## Insert Value into Middle of Array and Shift

Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and a value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency

For this code challenge I started with the visual and what needed to happen. After creating the visual and changing things around quite a bit I was able to work up an algorithm of what was needed. I then translated that into pseudoCode to work through it in human language. After that I put it to writing in code.
