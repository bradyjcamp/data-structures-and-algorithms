# Code Challenge Class 16

## Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree

## Challenge

- Write the following method for the Binary Tree class
  - find maximum value
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns: number

## Approach & Efficiency

Instantiated a Binary Tree and create a find max method that uses traversal to find the max in the tree and invoke it.

- This is an O(n) approach because it depends on how large the tree size is and how many values must be traversed

## API

- `maxTree()`
  - no args
  - returns a number

## Solution

- [Code](/javascript/401-code-challenges/tree-max/index.js)
- [Testing](/javascript/401-code-challenges/tree-max/__tests__/index.test.js)

### Checklist

- [x] Create a Binary Tree Class
- [x] Create findMax method
- [x] Create test for method
- [x] Pass all tests for each
