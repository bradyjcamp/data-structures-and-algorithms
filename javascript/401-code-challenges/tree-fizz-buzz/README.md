# Code Challenge Class 18

## FizzBuzz

Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a k-ary tree while traversing through it to create a new tree.
Set the values of each of the new nodes depending on the corresponding node value in the source tree.

## Challenge

- Write a function called fizz buzz tree

## Approach & Efficiency

- This is an O(n) approach for the method because it depends on how large the Kary tree is and how many child nodes there are.

## API

- `fizzBuzzTree()`
  - Argument: kary tree
  - Return: new k-ary tree

## Solution

- [Code](/javascript/401-code-challenges/tree-fizz-buzz/index.js)
- [Testing](/javascript/401-code-challenges/tree-fizz-buzz/__tests__/index.test.js)

### Checklist

- [x] Create a Kary Tree Class
- [x] Create a fizzBuzz method
- [x] Create tests for the method
- [x] Pass all tests
